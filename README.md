# Battleship 

A home-grown version of the Milton-Bradley game, Battleship, written in Python.   

Includes the a couple simplistic computer players, including a "random" player and a player which systematically tries to eliminate positions on the board where an opponent's ships might be still hiding.  

I mostly built this as a way to not have to play endless games of Battleship with my kids.  

Future plans: 
* a TUI-interface 
* 'salvo' variants 
* extract a more generic framework for replicating games with imperfect information
